<li><b>What is the semantic difference between PUT and POST?</b> - PUT requests are generally used to update resources whereas POST is used to create new resources
<ul>
<li><b>PUT </b>puts a file or resource at a particular URI and exactly at that URI. If there is already a file in this URI, then PUT will replace it.</li>
<li><b>POST </b>sends data to a specific URI and waits for a file or resource in that URI to process the request. At this point, the server decides what to do with the data in the context of that resource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Web protocols (HTTP and HTTPs, TCP/IP)</b>: These protocols explain how browsers communicate with clients. Knowledge of them is essential for understanding how your application is functioning and troubleshooting.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>How does HTTP relate to the TCP/IP stack?</b> there are different layers to communication protocols used to connect computer systems and HTTP is an Application layer used by web clients and web servers built on top of the Transport/Transmission layer (TCP) and the Network/Path control layer (IP).</li>
<li><b>continuous integration</b>Continuous integration specifically requires code integration into shared repositories multiple times each day of a project. This makes CI important for verifying each code integration, resulting in early detections of runtime errors, bugs and other problems in development.</li>

 <li><b>agile software development</b>Agile software development, also known as agile, is an incremental, collaborative approach. Agile is a method focused on continuously delivering work rather than waiting to deliver one big product. Because of how this process works, teams can improve the software as it’s developed, making it a more efficient delivery process.</li>
 <li><b>verification vs validation: </b>Both verification and validation are about ensuring your software does what it needs to do, but they focus on different aspects of the software. Verification ensures a function of the software works correctly; validation ensures the entire software works as the client wants it to.</li>
 <li><b>software re-engineering: </b>Software re-engineering is a process used to update software, where engineers may add new features or functionality or amend or alter the software to improve it. </li>
 <li><b>API</b>API stands for application programming interface. It acts as a messenger that allows two programs to talk to each other. For example, if you’re looking to go on a vacation, you might try to use a site that lists all available and cheapest flights on the days you want to travel. An API connects that site to airline flight information so you can quickly and easily get an aggregate list without combing through all the airline flight information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b> Main characteristics of a RESTful service: </b> A RESTful API (REST being short for REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to access and transform resources through web services. Such APIs are designed to be stateless and makes use of the native verbs of HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) as well as the notion that resources should be uniquely identifiable through a single URL that return back status representations of resources as JSON or XML. </li>
