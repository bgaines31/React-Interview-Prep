<li><b>List vs. Set: </b>A List is an ordered sequence of elements that may be duplicated whereas a Set is a collection of distinct elements which is unordered.</li>
<li><b> stack vs. queue: </b>The main differences between stack and queue are that stack uses LIFO (last in first out) method to access and add data elements whereas Queue uses FIFO (first in first out) method to access and add data elements. <br>
<br>
Use a queue when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in (an example would be handing calls in a call center in the order they were received). Use a stack when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in (good examples would be the browser back button or handling undo operations in a text editor).</li>
<li><b>The following are the types of data structures:</b>

Lists: A collection of related things linked to the previous or/and following data items.
Arrays: A collection of values that are all the same.
Records: A collection of fields, each of which contains data from a single data type.
Trees: A data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical framework. This form of data structure follows the ordered order of data item insertion, deletion, and modification.
Tables: The data is saved in the form of rows and columns. These are comparable to records in that the outcome or alteration of data is mirrored across the whole table.</li>
<li><b>Linear Data Structure: </b>A data structure is linear if all its elements or data items are arranged in a sequence or a linear order. The elements are stored in a non-hierarchical way so that each item has successors and predecessors except the first and last element in the list.

Examples of linear data structures are Arrays, Stack, Strings, Queue, and Linked List.</li>
