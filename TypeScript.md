<li><b>What is an interface in Typescript? </b>an interface is an abstract type that tells the compiler which property names a given object can have. TypeScript creates implicit interfaces when you define an object with properties. It starts by looking at the object's property name and data type using TypeScript's type inference abilities.</li>

<li><b>access modifiers: </b> The access modifiers supported by TypeScript are:
<ul>
<li><b>Protected- </b>All child classes and members have access to them, but the instance does not.
<li><b>Private- </b>Only members have access
<li><b>Public- </b>Members, child classes, and instances of the class have access to the public modifier.</li>
</ul>
<li><b> contextual typing: </b>Contextual typing occurs when the type of an expression is implied by its location.</li>
<li><b> Static typing: </b>TypeScript's static types mean variables, objects, and functions are predictable and limited to a specific type (or types)</li>
